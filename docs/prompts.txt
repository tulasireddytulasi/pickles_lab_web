I am developing a Celebreties Wallpapers app:

Feature: User can list images with filters

Filters:
1. Can search with DateTime
2. with name
3. Id

and there could different types like example:

Saree, Costumes, and dresses

Persons: example
Kajal with Ram Charan images

Now give perfect JOSN Object for this

I have an existing HTML code that I want to convert into an Flutter application using Dart. I want the app to follow the proper use of UI Widgets, Navigation, etc.

Please do not write the entire code in one go. Instead, follow this step-by-step process:
First, analyze the HTML code and provide a list of UI components required to build the screen.
I will go through the list and approve or adjust it.
Then, we will proceed by creating each UI component one at a time.
After each part is shared, I will check and validate it. If any issues arise, I’ll fix them or let you know before we move to the next part.
For data fetching, use fake APIs (like mock data or a mock server).
Follow a clean and scalable folder structure, and whenever you write code:
Mention the purpose of the code
Clearly specify the file name
Mention the folder/package name it belongs to.
And Create App Theme for entire app styles and colors

I have an existing HTML page that I want converted into a Flutter Web application using Dart. Follow a strict step-by-step approach (do not emit the whole app at once). The app is a “Pickles Dashboard” (web-first but mobile responsive). We already have reusable widgets for Left Navigation (sidebar) and Top Navigation (header / app bar) — reuse them.

High-level rules

Step-by-step only:

Step 1 (analysis): Analyze the HTML I’ll provide and produce a list of UI components required to build the screen (one message). I will review/approve adjustments.

Step 2+: After I approve the components list, implement one UI component at a time. After you share code for a component, I will validate it; we only move on when I approve.

Do not ask me to wait or promise future-delivered content. Provide each part in the current response when requested.

Every code snippet must include:

Purpose of the code (1–2 lines).

File name (exact).

Folder / package it belongs to (exact path).

If the file is a widget, state whether it’s stateless/stateful and why.

Folder structure: use a clean, scalable pattern (example below). Always place files in the correct folder and declare imports relative to that structure.

Mock APIs: Use fake APIs / mock data (local JSON files or a simple mock service). No real backend calls.

Styling & theme: Create a centralized AppTheme for colors, text styles, spacing, and breakpoints. All widgets must use that theme.

Responsiveness: The UI must be responsive across desktop/tablet/mobile widths. Use breakpoints and responsive layout widgets (e.g., LayoutBuilder, Flex, MediaQuery, ResponsiveBuilder pattern).

Navigation & routing: Use named routes or go_router (pick one and be consistent). Explain the navigation flow for the screen.

Reusability: Reuse Left and Top Navigation widgets. If they don't exist in code yet, create minimal reusable versions and place them under lib/widgets/ with clear names.

Accessibility & semantics: Use semantic widgets (buttons, InkWell, Tooltip, tappable areas), and make keyboard-accessible where relevant.

Testing / validation: Provide at least one small unit/widget test example for a key component when the main screen is built.

Code style: Use idiomatic Dart/Flutter patterns and comment non-obvious logic.
